Hello, friends !!! Welcome to ABC-gallery (to learn and use)
This gallery is full responsive and working in: IE6+, Opera, Safari and Firefox



## H O W - T O - U S E:

1. Don't forget, this plugin is written using JQuery - Library, when you definited your 
folder-structure, just embded this library at first, like you will find it in 'index.html'

<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.12.4.min.js"></script>

2. Next step is to embded the abc-gallery files (css & js). 
Take a look also to 'index.html'...

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href=".../your_folder/abc-gallery/abc-gallery-css.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src=".../your_folder/abc-gallery/abc-gallery-js.js"></script>

3. HTML-structure for ABC-gallery:

So that the ABC-gallery can manage your pictures, pack all the images into a DIV-element 
with class 'abc-gallery-div'.

Whether your pictures are arranged as a list, table or simply as links 
in this DIV-element does not matter...

I M P O R T A N T   is that each image element is provided with a link !!! 
a-tag, where you specify the path to the original image !!!

4. Paths & Folder:

The required files are: 'abc-gallery-css.css' + 'abc-gallery-js.js' !!!

in this example you'll find these files in 'abc-gallery'-folder. Images as (GIF, PNG, SVG) & 
used fonts are to find in the same folder.

If you wanna change the gallery-layout, use propierties in 'abc-gallery-js.js' 
for new browsers (IE9+ etc.)

For older IE versions change the images in following folders:

'no-image'-image:
abc-gallery/abc-gallery-images/no_image_png_svg
.../no-image.png

'preloader'-image:
'abc-gallery'--> abc-gallery-images/no_image_gif_svg/spin.gif
.../spin.svg

'navigation'-images:
'abc-gallery'--> icomoon_buttons_font/icomoon-imgs/actual-imgs/...

It is definitely very easy to set a new layout for ABC-gallery !!!




## W H Y - T O - U S E:

1. This gallery is programmed using OOP-JS-model and has a lot of layout properties, 
which can be very easy changed in: 'abc-gallery-js.js' - file.

Also you can without problems upgrade the gallery with your own effects and properties. 
Gallery is good readable even for young web-designers and has many useful comments.

If you set another JS-Libraries exept JQuery-Library - no problem, cause it was tested 
using 'JQuery - no conflict mode' and it works... see comments 'abc-gallery-js.js' lines 6-12

2. Because of practically interface-design, it's easy to use for young and older users, 
key-events (up, down, left, right & space and esc) are included for better handling. 
Slideshow-option bring more comfort for everyone decided to use this gallery.

3. It was decided to use crossbrowser-version 'jquery-1.12.4.min.js' (94,8 KB) 
(p.s. the same version used by bootstrap framework)

just take your time and use the scripts. The codes of this gallery are easy to understand 
and written for using this Jquery-plugin crossbrowsser and learn more about this : )## A B C - G A L L E R Y - I N S T R U C T I O N
